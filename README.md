# CLI_CV_Chatbot
This is a project to build a command line interface python program that creates a CV chatbot.

The project will utilise a LLM, Langchain, and RAG to limit its responses to a PDF document that contains my expanded CV and allow the program to answer questions about myself to potential employers. This project will end once i get a command line interface working with the model that can be incorporated on a website in a future project.  The goal of this project is to get the backend part of the project functioning before it is used on a website.  The project will initially use Google's gemma-3-1b-pt model run on a local machine. This can later be substituted out for larger models once the program is finished.
